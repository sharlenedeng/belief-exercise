<h1 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">What Is a Story?</h1>
<header>A story <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/story">story</a> is the telling or retelling of a series of events, <b>leading to a conclusion.</b></header>
<p>Now that we got that out of the way– let’s talk about how to tell a story.</p> 
<p>To tell a story, we often use <b>The 3 Act Structure</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Proposal</li>
    <li>Argument</li>
    <li>Conclusion</li></ul>
    
    
<p>Let's look at an example of what this might sound like:</p>
<h2>Act 1: Proposal</h2>
<p>"The most embarrassing thing happened to me the other day."</p>


<h2>Act 2: Argument</h2>
<p>“ I didn’t get much sleep the night before but I was in class and we spent the entire day gluing paper for our project. I was talking to my classmates and I reached into my pocket for chapstick but I ended up pulling out a glue stick instead and putting it on my lips.”
</p>
<h2>Act 3: Conclusion</h2>
<p>“The utter look of shock and confusion on everyone's faces was priceless but I was so embarrassed”(unfortunately this is a true story). 
</p>

<h2>These 3 Acts all lead to a point, what are they trying to say?</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about arguably, one of the best examples of storytelling in film (I might be biased because the feeling I had when I left the theater after watching it was incomparable)... 
</p>

<h2 
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/movies/bong-joon-ho-parasite.html">PARASITE</a></h2>
<P>To be honest, I could probably write an entire blog post about why this is such a great story and film but this would be one looooong blog post if we tried to break down the layers of depth Bong Joon-ho has successfully conveyed in this film. </P>

<p> What fuels this film’s "Best Picture" <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/09/movies/parasite-movie-oscars-best-picture.html">Best Picture</a> viability is its ability to demonstrate one of the central issues of our era <b>—inequality—</b>in surprising ways. </p>

<h2>Parasite is built around a question: Who is the Parasite?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This question is the proposal for the entire story and film</li>
    <li>The first act sets the context of which the movie is taking place. The audience is introduced to the setting <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/bong-joon-ho-parasite-movie-set-design-interview">setting</a> characters <a href="https://screenrant.com/parasite-kim-park-families-ranked-smartest/">characters</a> and the potential conflicts that may arise later on</li></ul>

    <h2>Bong's Argument</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bong builds the structure of the film in a way to make the audience ask the question of who the parasite actually is. His goal is not to preach a moral, but to show the complicated, socio-political landscape that reflects our society. </li>
        <li>This is a story about parasitic infiltration, about the way our society views each other as parasites. It’s about how the rich view the poor, how the poor view the rich and how the poor view the underclass as parasites.
        </li>
        <li>The question Bong is asking is one that he doesn’t necessarily fully know the answer to, and that’s what makes his exploration so interesting and compelling. 
        </li></ul>
    
    <h2>What's up with that ending though?</h2>
        <li>Bong attempts to reveal the realities of such a system. </li>
        <li>The drive to become part of the higher class can push us to be better, to fully utilize our talents—but it can also persuade us to wear a mask, to pretend we’re something we’re not.</li>
        <li>The audience can choose to read the ending in a hopeful or hopeless way which is part of the reason why I think this film was so successful in storytelling. </li></ul>

     <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
     <p>I’m sorry if you didn’t watch “Parasite” and therefore, had no idea what I was talking about. You can click here <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/plotsummary">here</a> and here <a href="http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2020/10-impressive-class-inequality-metaphors-in-parasite/">here</a> and here <a href="https://nofilmschool.com/symbols-in-parasite">here</a> for a brief synopsis, along with some deep analysis of the layers of the metaphors and motifs packed in this film to get a better understanding of why this story, while set in South Korea, is a universal story that we can all learn from.
