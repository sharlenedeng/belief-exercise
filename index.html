<header>A story is the telling or retelling of a series of events, leading to a conclusion.</header>
<p>Now that we got that out of the way– let’s talk about how to tell a story.</p> 
<p>To tell a story, we often use <b>The 3 Act Structure</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Proposal</li>
    <li>Argument</li>
    <li>Conclusion</li></ul> 
<p>Let's look at an example of what this might look like:</p>
<h3>Act 1: Proposal</h3>
<p>"The most embarrassing thing happened to me the other day."</p>
<h3>Act 2: Argument</h3>
<p>“ I didn’t get much sleep the night before but I was in class and we spent the entire day gluing paper for our project. I was talking to my classmates and I reached into my pocket for chapstick but I ended up pulling out a glue stick instead and putting it on my lips.”
</p>
<h3>Act 3: Conclusion</h3>
<p>“The look of shock and confusion on everyone's faces was priceless but I was so embarrassed”  (unfortunately this is a true story).
